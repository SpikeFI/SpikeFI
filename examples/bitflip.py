# An example to demonstrate a study of the network's resiliency to bitflips #
# in the synaptic weights and the importance of the bit positions.          #
#                                                                           #
# First, the configuration parameters defining the FI campaigns, need to be #
# set. The 'layers' parameter selects one or more layers subject to the FI  #
# experiments; the 'bits' parameter selects the targeted bit positions; and #
# finally, the 'qdtype' parameter selects the precision of the quantized    #
# data type. Next, preparing the demo environment, loading the network,     #
# and creating a data loader for the testing set, a nested for loop         #
# iterates over the targeted layers and bit positions one at a time, in     #
# order to create a separate campaign object for each combination. Each FI  #
# campaign then injects a sample of maximum 250^2 synaptic weights with a   #
# bit-flipped synapse error to the synapses of the current layer at the     #
# current bit position. Each fault is injected as a distinct fault round    #
# containing a single fault each, so that the network's reliability is      #
# examined with perspective to each synaptic weight and faulty bit position.#
# At the end of each FI campaign execution, results are stored in a file    #
# and are visualized using a heat map plot, which is also saved as an image.#
