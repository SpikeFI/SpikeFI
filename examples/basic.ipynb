    "After loading a trained network (see 'train_golden' example), a campaign object is initiated. First, three faults are defined, namely fx, fy, and fz, which are injected in two fault rounds to form various scenarios of FI experiments. The classification accuracy of the faulty networks is reported for each experiment and the results are stored in a file. Continuing, the campaign object is reset and a new FI campaign is initiated to perform the complete assessment of the network's output layer by injected one bitflipped synapse fault at the MSB of every synaptic weight of the layer. Then, the FI experiment targets each synapse individually, meaning that only one synapse is faulty at a time. Finally, results are plotted in a heat map and stored in a file. This example is the implementation of the pseudo-code presented in the SpikeFI scientific publication."
