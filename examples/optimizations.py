# An example for the demonstration of the SpikeFI optimization techniques   #
# and their effect in the fault simulation acceleration.                    #
#                                                                           #
# The configuration parameters in this example are the following six:       #
# 1. The targeted fault model to be used in the FI experiments;             #
# 2. The layers to be subject for the locations of the injected faults;     #
# 3. The batch size(s) for the dataset to compare;                          #
# 4. The number(s) of faults to be injected;                                #
# 5. The optimization setting(s) to compare;                                #
# 6. The tolerance of the Early Stop optimization (if applied).             #
# After preparing the demo environment, nested for-loops iterate over the   #
# targeted configuration parameters to create FI campaigns for all the FI   #
# experiments to be conducted. In the case that a selected fault number is  #
# less than the size of the targeted layer(s), fault sampling is applied.   #
# If more than one fault numbers are selected, then each FI campaign        #
# targeting the same layer(s), stars with the previous faults plus new ones #
# to meet the fault number target. If early stop optimization is applied    #
# and a tolerance other than zero is selected, a .csv file is stored with   #
# relative information on the number of critical faults. Finally, the       #
# results of each FI campaign are saved in separate pickle files.           #
