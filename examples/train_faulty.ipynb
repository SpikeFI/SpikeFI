    "_An example of fault injections before training._\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, faults are injected before the training of the network. Faults of the selected fault model are injected in one or more sites in the targeted layers of the network, expressed as a percentage of the total neurons or synapses, depending on the type of the fault model. The result of the FI experiments is a newly trained instance of the network for each fault round, that is, for each fault percentage. Finally, the networks are exported as .pt files, the campaign information is stored in a .pkl file, and the learning curve(s) are plotted and stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to initialize the 'net' variable to an already trained instance of a network, and then re-train it with faults."
