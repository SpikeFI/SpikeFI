# SpikeFI
### *A Fault Injection Framework for Spiking Neural Networks*

This is the main repository of the *SpikeFI* framework.


## Abstract

Neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks (SNNs) are gaining traction across various artificial intelligence (AI) tasks thanks to their potential for efficient energy usage and faster computation speed. This comparative advantage comes from mimicking the structure, function, and efficiency of the biological brain, which arguably is the most brilliant and green computing machine. As SNNs are eventually deployed on a hardware processor, the reliability of the application in light of hardware-level faults becomes a concern, especially for safety- and mission-critical applications. We propose *SpikeFI*, a fault injection framework for SNNs that can be used for automating the reliability analysis and test generation. *SpikeFI* is built upon the SLAYER PyTorch framework with fault injection experiments accelerated on a single or multiple GPUs. It has a comprehensive integrated neuron and synapse fault model library, in accordance to the literature in the domain, which is extendable by the user if needed. It supports: single and multiple faults; permanent and transient faults; specified, random layer-wise, and random network-wise fault locations; and pre-, during, and post-training fault injection. It also offers several optimization speedups and built-in functions for results visualization. *SpikeFI* is open-source.

## Requirements

SpikeFI requires Python 3 and it has been tested to work with version 3.11 or newer.

The following packages are required to be installed before proceeding with using *SpikeFI*:
- `pytorch` ≥ v2.1*
- `matplotlib` ≥ v3.7
- `numpy` ≥ v1.26*
- `pyyaml` ≥ v6.0
- `tqdm` ≥ v4.67
- `cycler` ≥ v0.12
- [`slayer`](https://github.com/bamsumit/slayerPytorch) ≥ v0.1

_*`numpy` version 2 is not yet supported. `torch` needs to have support for `numpy` < v2.0 (tested successfully up to `torch` v2.6)._

`slayer` requires a CUDA-enabled GPU for training SNN models.

*SpikeFI* has been tested with CUDA libraries version 12.1 up to 12.8 and GCC 11.5 to 13.2 on Almalinux 9.3, Ubuntu 24.04, and Red Hat Linux 9.5 using NVIDIA A100 80GB, NVIDIA Quadro RTX 4000, and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPUs.


## Installation

To properly install *SpikeFI*, please follow the instructions below at the correct order. A clean environment of Python is recommended.

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone the *SpikeFI* and SLAYER repositories to the directory of your preference:

```
git clone https://github.com/SpikeFI/SpikeFI.git
git clone https://github.com/bamsumit/slayerPytorch.git
```

### 2. Install PyTorch

Install any version of `pytorch` from v2.1 onwards with the combination of the CUDA version supported by your system. For example, to install the latest version of `pytorch` execute the following command:

`pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio`

For more information, please consult the get-started instructions on the PyTorch website [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally).

### 3. Install the requirements

All the requirements are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. To install them you can use the following command (after switching to the SpikeFI main directory):

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

### 4. Install SLAYER

From __within the SLAYER directory__, run the following command:

`python3 setup.py install`

For more information about the SLAYER framework, feel free to visit its GitHub page [here](https://github.com/bamsumit/slayerPytorch).

### 5. Install SpikeFI

Run the following command from SpikeFI directory to install the framework:

`pip3 install .`

### Putting it altogether

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/SpikeFI/SpikeFI.git
git clone https://github.com/bamsumit/slayerPytorch.git
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
pip3 install -r ./SpikeFI/requirements.txt
cd ./slayerPytorch/
python3 setup.py install
cd ../SpikeFI/
pip3 install .
```


## Package Structure

The *SpikeFI* package contains the following modules:
- __core__: *main functionality*
- __fault__: *classes composing a Fault*
- __models__: *integrated fault library*
- __visual__: *visualization functions*
- __utils__: *utility functions*
    - __io__: *io and file helper*
    - __layer__: *snn layer information helper*
    - __progress__: *extended progress bar and info*
    - __quantization__: *weight quantization helper*


## Demonstration

*SpikeFI* is equipped with a `demo` package and a set of examples to easily get started and familiarize with its functionality.

### Preparation

### 1. Install the demo requirements

The `demo` package has some dependencies in addition to the `spikefi` package, which are listed in the `requirements_demo.txt` file in the examples directory. To install them you can use the following command from within the *SpikeFI* main directory:

`pip3 install -r examples/requirements_demo.txt`

### 2. Install the neuromorphic datasets

To simplify and accelerate the get-started experience, `demo` is equipped with scripts that manage the setup of the dataset files, that is, converting them in the proper file format and arranging them in the needed directories.

### <u>N-MNIST Dataset</u>

To install the N-MNIST dataset, simply execute the following commands:

```
cd examples/
python3 -m demo.setup_nmnist
```

`setup_nmnist` downloads the N-MNIST dataset files, extracts them, converts them in the needed binary format, and places them under the proper directory hierarchy. The default setup location is set at `examples/demo/datasets/`, which can be modified by passing another directory path with the `--dir` argument. If the dataset's `.zip` file has already been downloaded, the `--archive` argument accepts the path to it and skips re-downloading it. Finally, the `--force` argument, forces a clean (re-)installment of the dataset. Here follows an example of the full command:

`python3 -m demo.setup_nmnist [-h] [--force] [--dir DEST_DIR] [-- archive DATASET_ARCHIVE]`

### <u>IBM DVS128 Gesture Dataset</u>

Installing the IBM DVS128 Gesture dataset follows a similar procedure as previously. The only difference is that the <u>__dataset archive needs to be downloaded in advance__</u> and its path to be designated with the `--archive` argument.

```
cd examples/
python3 -m demo.setup_gesture --archive path_to_dataset_archive
```

A full example of the `setup_gesture.py` script is as follows:

`python3 -m demo.setup_gesture --archive DATASET_ARCHIVE [-h] [--force] [--dir DEST_DIR]`

### Trained SNN models

*SpikeFI* is delivered with a trained SNN model for each of the above datasets. The network architectures and dataset classes in PyTorch are located at `examples/demo/architectures` and the trained instances at `examples/demo/models`. The network configuration parameters, necessary for the SLAYER framework, can be found at `examples/demo/config`.

### Examples

The *examples* directory contains indicative cases of using *SpikeFI* in various scenarios, demonstrating how to use the framework's features and capabilities.

The available examples are the following:
- __Basic Example__: *Basic usage of SpikeFI's features*
- __Bit-flip Example__: *Reliability analysis of SNNs to bit-flip faults in the synaptic weights*
- __Optimizations Example__: *SpikeFI's optimization techniques and fault simulation acceleration*
- __Parametric Example__: *Reliability analysis of SNNs to parametric neuron faults*
- __Train Golden Example__: *Training a fault-free SNN with SpikeFI*
- __Train Faulty Example__: *Fault injection experiments before training*

Each example is available both as a python script file `.py` and as a Jupyter notebook `.ipynb`.

To execute an example, it is possible by opening and running the corresponding notebook, or by by executing the following command from SpikeFI main directory:

`python3 examples/<example_name>.py`

After the execution of an example is over, its results (output files) can be found in the `SpikeFI/examples/out` directory.
